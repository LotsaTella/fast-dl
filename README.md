**FAST-DL FOR RING RACERS**

this should, in theory, act as a http source for ring racers servers, will likely be used for friend groups only, ofc credits to all the addon devs yall are awesome


**SETUP**

simply replace the url defined in the "http_source" setting in ring racers's "ringconfig.cfg" file with "https://cocoasprinkle.github.io/fast-dl/ringracers"
